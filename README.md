# TIMO

An app that you can rely on to be punctual. 

People use various platforms to check weather/traffic conditions as a part of their daily routine to reach a destination. However, the process requires the user to manually check apps, as well as input alarms (based off estimating the time they have).

Our app, Timo, is intended to help people who struggle with punctuality, by integrating the confusing plethora of technologies needed to plan a journey and preventing tardiness (unlike existing scheduling, navigation, weather, and alarm services).

Our tech stack: Flutter and Firebase.
